# Visualize earthquake data from [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) using Leaflet

* Marker size and color reflect magnitude of earthquake. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.
* Marker popups provide additional information about the earthquake.
* Legend provide context for magnitude.
* A number of base maps is available to choose from and overlays can be turned on and off independently.
* A second layer is added to the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
